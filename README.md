<h1 align="center"> 👋 Individual Project Countries!</h1>
This is an individual project in which I must build a Single Page Application using the technologies: React, Redux, Node, Express, and Sequelize.

<h2 align="left">🔧 Instalation </h2>

If you want to be able to have this project, you can apply the following command in your console: 

```

```

Once you have cloned the repository, perform the installation of the necessary dependencies, in the same console, through the following command:

```
npm install
```
Finally, on two different consoles, placing each of the consoles on the "back" and "front" folders, respectively, apply the following command equally:

```
npm start
```

Great, now you can see this application running in your browser. Success with those modifications.🚀🚀

<h2 align="left">⚙️ Running the tests </h2>

You can run some tests on the "back", open the terminal in the corresponding folder and type the command:

```
npm test
```
